= Spring Cloud Sleuth OTel Features

include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section dives into the details of {project-full-name}.
Here you can learn about the key features that you may want to use and customize.
If you have not already done so, you might want to read the "<<getting-started.adoc#getting-started>>" and "<<using.adoc#using>>" sections, so that you have a good grounding in the basics.

[[features-context-propagation]]
== Context Propagation

Traces connect from service to service using header propagation.
The default format is https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation[B3].
Similar to data formats, you can configure alternate header formats also, provided trace and span IDs are compatible with B3. Most notably, this means the trace ID and span IDs are lower-case hex, not UUIDs.
Besides trace identifiers, other properties (Baggage) can also be passed along with the request.
Remote Baggage must be predefined, but is flexible otherwise.

To use the provided defaults you can set the `spring.sleuth.propagation.type` property.
The value can be a list in which case you will propagate more tracing headers.

For OpenTelemetry we support `AWS`, `B3`, `JAEGER`, `OT_TRACER` and `W3C` via the `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-extension-trace-propagators` dependency that you have to manually add to your classpath.

You can read more about how to provide custom context propagation in this "<<howto.adoc#how-to-change-context-propagation,how to section>>".

[[features-otel]]
== OpenTelemetry Tracer Integration

Spring Cloud Sleuth integrates with the OpenTelemetry (OTel in short) SDK tracer via the bridge that is available in the `spring-cloud-sleuth-otel` module.
In this section you can read about specific OTel integrations.

You can choose to use either Sleuth's API or the OpenTelemetry API directly in your code (e.g. either Sleuth's `Tracer` or OpenTelemetry's `Tracer`).
If you want to use this tracer implementation's API directly please read https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java[their documentation to learn more about it].

[[features-otel-exporters]]
=== OpenTelemetry Exporters Integration

[[features-otel-logging]]
==== OpenTelemetry Logging

We're providing an Slf4j integration via a `SpanProcessor` that injects to and removes entries (trace / span ids, baggage, tags etc.) from MDC. You can disable that via the `spring.sleuth.otel.log.slf4j.enabled=false` property.

If it's there on the classpath, we integrate with the `LoggingSpanExporter`.
You can disable that integration via the `spring.sleuth.otel.log.exporter.enabled=false` property.

[[features-otel-jaeger]]
==== OpenTelemetry Jaeger Integration

We're providing an out-of-the-box integration with the OTel Jaeger exporter. via the `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger` dependency.

For configuration options please check the `spring.sleuth.otel.exporter.jaeger` properties in the <<appendix.adoc,appendix>>. To fully override the default configuration please register a bean of `JaegerGrpcSpanExporter` type.

[[features-otel-otlp]]
==== OpenTelemetry OTLP Integration

We're providing an out-of-the-box integration with the OTel OTLP gRPC exporter. via the `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` dependency.

For configuration options please check the `spring.sleuth.otel.exporter.otlp` properties in the <<appendix.adoc,appendix>>. To fully override the default configuration please register a bean of `OtlpGrpcSpanExporter` type.


[[features-otel-resource-provider]]
=== OpenTelemetry ResourceProvider

OpenTelemetry provides a `Resource` abstraction which captures identifying information about the entities for which signals (stats or traces) are reported. If you wish to provide your own, you can register beans of `Supplier<Resource>` type.

You can disable the registration of the default `Supplier<Resource>` beans via the `spring.sleuth.otel.resource.enabled=false` property.

[[features-otel-opentracing]]
=== OpenTelemetry Opentracing

You can integrate with OpenTelemetry and https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] via the
`io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-opentracing-shim` bridge.
Just add it to the classpath and the OpenTracing `Tracer` will be set up automatically.

[[features-zipkin]]
== Sending Spans to Zipkin

Spring Cloud Sleuth provides various integrations with the https://zipkin.io[OpenZipkin] distributed tracing system.
Regardless of the chosen tracer implementation it's enough to add `spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin` to the classpath to start sending spans to Zipkin.
You can choose whether to do that via HTTP or messaging.
You can read more about how to do that in "<<howto.adoc#how-to-set-up-sleuth-with-otel-zipkin-messaging,how to section>>".
